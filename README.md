| ## Better Body Co. Blogpost SEO Optimisation Project |
| ---------------------------------------------------- |

### Project Description

I am assigned to set up a blog post with SEO optimization for Better Body Co., owned by Maneuver Marketing. After consulting with experienced SEO analysts, we have identified the following considerations for an ideal blog post:

- [ ] Create internal linking to services/product pages.
- [ ] Include a call-to-action (CTA) at the end.
- [ ] Meta title should contain the targeted keyword within 60 characters.
- [ ] Craft an enticing meta description with a CTA within 160 characters.
- [ ] Use an H1 tag with targeted keywords.
- [ ] Utilize H2 tags for subtitles of the content.
- [ ] Incorporate the targeted keywords every 100 words.

To achieve these objectives, I sought advice from ChatGPT and obtained the following resources:

| 1.  | **Semantic HTML**:<br>Use proper HTML tags to structure your content. Include header tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraph tags (`<p>`), and other relevant tags to define the different sections of your blog post. This helps search engines understand the hierarchy and importance of your content.                   |
| 2.  | **Keyword Research**:<br>Perform keyword research to identify relevant keywords and phrases related to your blog post. Incorporate these keywords naturally into your content, including headings, paragraphs, and image alt tags. However, avoid keyword stuffing, as it can harm your SEO.                           |
| 3.  | **Title Tag and Meta Description**:<br>Each blog post should have a unique and descriptive title tag (defined using `<title>`) and meta description (using the `<meta name="description" content="...">` tag). These elements appear in search engine results, so make them compelling and relevant to attract clicks. |
| 4.  | **URL Structure**:<br>Use clean and readable URLs that include relevant keywords related to your blog post. For example, instead of using "www.example.com/page1?id=123," use "www.example.com/keyword-rich-blog-post-title." This helps search engines and users understand what the page is about.                   |
| 5.  | **Responsive Design**:<br>Ensure your blog post is mobile-friendly and responsive to different screen sizes. This is important because search engines prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their rankings, and a responsive design improves user experience.                                                         |
| 6.  | **Page Loading Speed**:<br>Optimize your blog post's loading speed by minifying CSS and JavaScript files, compressing images, and utilizing caching techniques. Faster-loading pages tend to rank higher in search engine results and provide a better user experience.                                                |
| 7.  | **Internal and External Linking**:<br>Include relevant internal links within your blog post to other pages on your website. This helps search engines discover and index other content on your site. Additionally, consider linking to external reputable sources to provide more value to your readers.               |
| 8.  | **Image Optimization**:<br>Optimize your images by reducing file sizes without compromising quality. Use descriptive filenames and add alt tags (`alt="..."`) to provide alternative text for search engines to understand what the image is about. This can improve image search rankings and accessibility.          |
| 9.  | **Schema Markup**:<br>Implement schema markup using structured data to provide additional context to search engines about your content. This can enhance how your blog post appears in search results, potentially leading to higher click-through rates.                                                              |
| 10. | **Social Sharing Buttons**:<br>Include social sharing buttons on your blog post to make it easy for readers to share your content                                                                                                                                                                                      |
