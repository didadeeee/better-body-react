## **Better Body Co. Blogpost with SEO**

### Project Description

I created a blog post for [Better Body Co.](https://betterbody.co/), owned by [Maneuver Marketing](https://maneuvermarketing.com/) within 48 hours.
<br>

Inspired by a minimalist blogpost design on [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/resources/stablo/demo), I have decided to create the app with the following tech stack:

1. React.js
2. HTML5 (JSX)
3. CSS
4. Vercel Deployment
<br>

The key UI/UX features, inspired by many online resources, are as follows:

- **Individual tags**: Enhance user interactivity with clear categorization and easy navigation.
- **Brand color highlight**: Emphasize branding and create a cohesive experience during hover interactions.
- **Collapsible field**: Maintain a clean layout with expandable references and disclaimers.
- **Relevant images**: Improve user experience by visually supporting the content and engaging readers.
<br>

After consulting with experienced SEO analysts and online resources, we have identified the following considerations for an ideal blog post:
1. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper tags for content structure, aiding search engine understanding.
2. **Keyword Research**: Incorporate relevant keywords naturally into headings, paragraphs, and image alt tags.
3. **Title Tag and Meta Description**: Craft unique and compelling tags to attract clicks in search results.
4. **URL Structure**: Opt for clean, keyword-rich URLs for better search engine and user comprehension.
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-friendly layout for improved search rankings and user experience.
6. **Page Loading Speed**: Optimize speed through minification, compression, and caching techniques.
7. **Internal and External Linking**: Include relevant links to improve discoverability and provide value.
8. **Image Optimization**: Reduce file sizes, use descriptive filenames, and add alt tags for better search visibility.
9. **Schema Markup**: Implement structured data for enhanced search result appearance and click-through rates.
10. **Social Sharing Buttons**: Facilitate easy content sharing with social sharing buttons.
